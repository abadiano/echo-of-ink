1) Generally speaking 3 pages: main; inspiration - kinda why i did it; technical - RNNs; GPT-2; Open AI call; maybe LSTM; GNU;
2) top of screen - two links - inspiration and technical
3) Below it - proly image + tool name, for now PushkinAI
4) Below it usage instruction, which would reference two other pages
5) Below it is a chat form
6) And some kind of a footer



Comment for 4th - potentially change the layout - instruction to be displayed on the left side of the screen and the chatbox on the right
